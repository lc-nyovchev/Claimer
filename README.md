A simple app to attemt to randomly "guess" an invite like this: https://account.oneplus.net/invite/claim/KFBS-IBDL-3PQD-FCDH for a OnePlus phone.

A single thread can handle about 6 invites per second. 

Keep in mind that chances of actually getting an invite are miniscule (there are 36^16 combinations which is a huge number, even in computing)

Also, keep in mind that there are certain violations ethics behind claiming something that is not yours (and a certain romanticism, alas).
